A basic FrontEnd and BackEnd website, using react and mongoDB,
The app is a comment system, that allows user to comment only when they registered and logged to the website
A basic css design, the app contain a login and registration forms, using bcrypt for basic password encryption,
using JWT-token for user authentication.
I used Express on the server side with Joi(npm-package for validations).
Worked with axios on the client side for the requests.
